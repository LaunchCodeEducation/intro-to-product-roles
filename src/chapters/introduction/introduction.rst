About LaunchCode Programs + Work Expectations:

1.3. About LaunchCode Programs

1.3.1. Goals
We want our programs to help you build your problem solving skills and encourage you to learn how to learn. Whether you use the skills you gain in this program to get a product related job is up to you. However, no matter the path you take after this program, learning how to learn will help you continually adapt to the changing needs of your industry. 

Our goal is to teach you the skills found in various industries to help you be successful.

1.3.3. Course activities
We only have a short amount of time in class to learn a lot, so we have spent a lot of time creating the course activities to make the most of your in-class and out-of-class time. While there are a lot of different activities we will do in a day, it is important to actively engage with each activity. Skipping any required course activity can quickly lead to struggling in the class.

1.3.3.1. Prep Work
Prep Work is done before each class session and covers the topics that you will learn about that day. Prep Work will typically consist of reading, videos, small exercises, and questions to check your understanding. We have found that studying the material before class helps students make the most of their short in-class time. It is essential to practice in order to reinforce your understanding of the new concepts. Expect 10-15 hours of Prep Work each week.

1.3.3.2. In-class Time

In-class Time will be structured to give the class time to review examples as a group and shore up concepts from the prep work.In class there will be an instructor and teaching assistants. This dedicated staff facilitates the activities and provides support to the students. In class you will meet many fellow students on the same learning journey as you. We encourage students to engage, interact, and encourage each other throughout the class.

The whole class participates in the lesson, led by the instructor. The lesson is not a substitute for doing the prep work before class. After the large group time, we will break up into small groups. During small group time, we will do larger in-class activities called studios. This time allows you to get more individual support from your classmates and teaching staff. It is also  a time where you can feel comfortable talking openly about concepts you are struggling with.

1.3.3.4.  Graded Assignments
Graded Assignments are larger projects that occur periodically where you demonstrate what you have learned and challenge yourself. Assignments oftentimes cover multiple lessons. Successfully completing Graded Assignments is one important way that we will evaluate your success in this course.

1.3.3.5.  Final Project
The Final Project is a project that you will complete over the course of “X” weeks that will allow you to demonstrate your knowledge of important course concepts. Successfully completing the Final Project is another important way that we will evaluate your success in this course.
