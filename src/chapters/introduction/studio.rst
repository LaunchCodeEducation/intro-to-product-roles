Studio: Lesson 1
================

Today’s studio is the first studio you will complete for this class! Studio time gives you a chance to practice applying the concepts you have learned from the prep work and in class lectures as a group. In today’s Studio,  you will complete a Conceptual Map and a “Humans in Context” chart for the TSA business case. Your instructor should introduce the business case to you before starting this activity. We will use this business case throughout the course. The requirements are highlighted in more detail below. Use the Design Thinking textbook and notes from class as a guide.

Requirements
Read the TSA business case. Discuss your questions with your group.
Complete a Conceptual Map.
Complete a “Humans in Context” chart.

Part 2: Conceptual Map
Conceptual maps allow you to visually illustrate the relationship between the individual user or groups of users, physical or virtual artifacts of the process, and how they relate to one another.

Spend 45 minutes in your small group completing  a conceptual map. Remember to consider these questions:

What are all the entities in the ecosystem?
How do they interact?
What are the relationships? 

Part 3: Humans in Context chart
Humans in Context charts allow you to further explore the humans from your Conceptual Map. Spend 35 minutes in your same small group to complete this chart. You should be addressing the following topics:

Who are the TSA humans?
Brainstorm their concern, stake, agency, and influence.
Define adjacent roles that are not in the concept map. 


Congratulations! You completed your first Studio activity. Discuss your findings with the class.
